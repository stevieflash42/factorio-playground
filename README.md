# Factorio Playground

Dabbling in decoding, manipulating, and creating Factorio blueprint strings programmatically.

## Installation

No external dependencies required! Uses only Python standard library.
- I saw [factorio-draftsman](https://github.com/redruin1/factorio-draftsman) show up in my cursory searches, so I am considering scrapping this repo altogether, but I wanted to fiddle a little

## Quick Start

```bash
# Using pip 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or using pip in a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json)
